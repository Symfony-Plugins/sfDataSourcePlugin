/**
 * This interface allows classes to read a wide variety of two-dimensional
 * data sources such as relational databases, XML files, CSV files etc. in a
 * unified way. Two-dimensional data sources are any data sources that can
 * be structured in rows and columns.
 *
 * The methods of SeekableIterator allow to iterate all the rows of the data
 * source. The methods of ArrayAccess, on the other hand, allow to access the
 * fields in the current row in a unified way.
 *
 * <code>
 * $source = new ConcreteDataSource();
 * for ($source->rewind(); $source->valid(); $source->next())
 * {
 *   echo $source['column_name'];
 * }
 * </code>
 *
 * This interface is very flexible because you don't depend on the implementation
 * of the data source. It does not matter whether the data is stored in Propel
 * objects, in arrays or in strings.
 *
 * In most cases, however, you will want to work directly with the underlying
 * data types (e.g. Propel objects). This is why the method current() used by
 * the iterator always returns the current row in the original format.
 *
 * <code>
 * $source = new ObjectDataSource();
 * foreach ($source as $object)
 * {
 *   $object->callMethod();
 * }
 *
 * $source = new ArrayDataSource();
 * foreach ($source as $array)
 * {
 *   echo $array['key'];
 * }
 * </code>
 *
 * You can use the remaining methods of this interface to preprocess the data
 * before iterating it. You can call setSort() to sort the data, setOffset()
 * to skip a given amount of rows or setLimit() to tell the iterator to stop
 * after processing a given amount of rows. Calling setOffset() and setLimit()
 * before iterating may, depending on the implementation, result in a greater
 * processing performance (f.i. LIMIT and OFFSET clauses in SQL data sources).
